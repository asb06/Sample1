Creating a branch
Create a Git branch
$ git fetch && git checkout <feature_name>

Make your changes locally and then add, commit, and push your changes to the feature branch:
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "adding a change from the feature branch"
$ git push origin <feature_branch>

You can create a branch locally as long as you have a cloned version of the repo.
From your terminal window, list the branches on your repository.

$ git branch
* master
This output indicates there is a single branch, the master and the asterisk indicates it is currently active.

Create a new feature branch in the repository
$ git branch <feature_branch>

Switch to the feature branch to work on it.
$ git checkout <feature_branch>

You can list the branches again with the git branch command.
Commit the change to the feature branch:
$ git add .

$ git commit -m "adding a change from the feature branch"
Switch back to the master branch.
$ git checkout master

Merge changes from the <feature_branch> into the master branch:
$ git merge <feature_branch>

Push the feature branch to Bitbucket:
$ git push origin <feature_branch>
